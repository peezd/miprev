								<p>Heya, I'm Micah. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  </p>
								<p>I'm proud to have served as a Peace Corps volunteer to Ukraine, serving in an economic development capacity. Since then, I've bounced around a bit until landing in Colorado in the Denver area, and spend as much time as possible in the high country, ideally out backcountry skiing, mountain biking, or just hiking with the dogs. </p>
								<p>Career wise I fell into product management in the 00s, and developed a passion for understanding how to build amazing products, specifically software and technology based tools. I've been lucky enough to work with some amazing solutions and software architects and engineers throughout my career that have helped me along and I've realized the peopel you work with matter more than just about anything else. Namaste. </p>

								<p>Page to outline a few of my interests.</p>
								<p><b>Western Border Collie Rescue:</b> We volunteer and support Western Border Collie Rescue; Western Border Collie Rescue is an all-volunteer organization working in and around the Rocky Mountain region. Their mission is to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home Border Collies that have been abandoned, neglected or are no longer able to remain in their current home. Founded in 2003, WBCR has saved over 1000 dogs.<br>

								<p><b>CAIC:</b> My partner and I are avid backcountry ski enthusiasts. Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) is an organization responsible for monitoring and reporting on snow and avalance conditions. With Colorado having a very volatile snowpack, their work is essential in enjoying the sport responsibly. More information on their website <a href="https://www.avalanche.state.co.us/">here.</a>

								<p>I'm typically always reading two books or more concurrently. One will be for fun and typically fiction that may span genres, but I love post-apocalyptic and near future / futurology books along with cyberpunk. William Gibson is one of my favorite authors, with my first read of Neuromancer a life changing experience. </p>
								<p> The other area is around personal or professional development (often career and leadership related). On the latter, anything by Brené Brown or Adam Grant resonate with me, but there are a lot of great authors in the space.</p>
