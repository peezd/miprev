								<p>Heya, I'm Micah. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  </p>
								<p>I'm an accomplished Product management and technology leader. I fell into product management in the 00s, and worked with some amazing teammates and mentors that helped me develop a passion for understanding how to build amazing products that delight customers. Primary specialization in 0-1, Platform, and Technical product management areas, covering B2B and B2C across a bunch of industries and domains.<br><br> I've been lucky enough to work with some amazing architects and engineers throughout my career that have helped me along and I've realized the people you work with matter more than just about anything else. I'm also passionate about ESG and social impact, and happiest working in mission-driven organizations.</p>
								<p>I'm also an avid exercise and outdoors enthusiast, and in a previous life I'm proud to have served as a Peace Corps volunteer to Ukraine in an economic development program. I'm currently in Colorado and can usually be found in Denver or the high country of Summit County. Depending on time of year, I can be found out ski touring, climbing, mountain biking, paddleboarding or hiking with our two trouble-making border collies.</p>

								<p>I also have an interest in how companies can leverage technology to address core societal problems (such as income equality or climate change), and am a strong proponent of companies that identify corporate social responsibility as a core part of their business objectives.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="Placeholder image" /></span>
								<p>Some of my interests include:</p>
								<p><b>Mountain Biking:</b> After realizing I often couldn't find video and trail profiles when I was scoping out new areas to ride, I spun up a channel with (mostly) Mountain Bike videos from some of my favorite trails. I can be found on Youtube <a href="https://youtube.com/peezdyits">Here.</a>
								<p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mtb1.jpg" alt="MTB picture" /></span></p>
								<p><b>Western Border Collie Rescue:</b> We volunteer and support Western Border Collie Rescue; Western Border Collie Rescue is an all-volunteer organization working in and around the Rocky Mountain region. Their mission is to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home Border Collies that have been abandoned, neglected or are no longer able to remain in their current home. Founded in 2003, WBCR has saved over 1000 dogs. A few pictures of our foster failures are below.<br>

								<hr>
								<p><b>CAIC:</b> My partner and I are avid backcountry ski enthusiasts. Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) is an organization responsible for monitoring and reporting on snow and avalance conditions. With Colorado having a very volatile snowpack, their work is essential in enjoying the sport responsibly. More information on their website <a href="https://www.avalanche.state.co.us/">here.</a>

								<p>I really enjoy learning and reading. For fiction, I'm drawn towards post-apocalyptic and futurology books with a heavy lean towards cyberpunk. William Gibson is one of my favorite authors, with my first read of Neuromancer a life changing experience. </p>
								<p> I'm also always reading for personal or professional development (often career and leadership related). Recent reads I've enjoyed have included <i>Build</i> by Tony Fadell, <i>The Art of the Good Life</i> by Rolf Dobelli, and <i>Statistics Done Wrong</i> by Alex Reinhart .</p>
