								<p>Heya, I'm Micah. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  </p>
								<p>I'm proud to have served as a Peace Corps volunteer to Ukraine, serving in an economic development role. Since then, I've bounced around a bit until landing in Colorado splitting time between the Denver area and the high country. Can be found out ski touring, climbing, mountain biking, paddleboarding and hiking with the dogs.</p>
								<p>Career wise I fell into product management in the 00s, and developed a passion for understanding how to build amazing products, specifically software and technology based tools. Primary specialization in 0-1, PLatform, and Technical product management areas. I've been lucky enough to work with some amazing solutions and software architects and engineers throughout my career that have helped me along and I've realized the people you work with matter more than just about anything else. Namaste. </p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="Classy San Francisco skyline" /></span>
								<p>I'm a seasoned product strategist and technology expert, specializing in crafting and driving product-driven strategy, and building high performing teams and empowering them to deliver their best work.</p>
								<p>I've consistently been identified as an exceptional performer and recognized as the go-to resource to get things done throughout my career, adept and comfortable transitioning between org levels, from building and delivering a strategic 5 year plan to board members, to engaging with customers directly for input, to peering with exceptional engineers to track down that impossible to trace bug.</p>
								<p>I also have an interest in how companies can leverage technology to address core societal problems (such as income equality or climate change), and am a strong proponent of companies that identify corporate social responsibility as a core part of their business objectives.</p>

								<p>I really enjoy learning and reading. For fiction, I love post-apocalyptic and futurology books with a heavy lean towards cyberpunk. William Gibson is one of my favorite authors, with my first read of Neuromancer a life changing experience. </p>
								<p> The other area is around personal or professional development (often career and leadership related). Recent reads I've enjoyed have included Build by Tony Fadell, Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert, and Statistics Done Wrong by Alex Reinhart .</p>
