								<p>Heya, I'm Micah. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  </p>
								<p>I'm an avid exercise and outdoors enthusiast as well as an accomplished Product management leader. I fell into product management in the 00s, and developed a passion for understanding how to build amazing products that delight customers. Primary specialization in 0-1, Platform, and Technical product management areas, covering B2B and B2C across a bunch of industries and domains.<br> I've been lucky enough to work with some amazing architects and engineers throughout my career that have helped me along and I've realized the people you work with matter more than just about anything else. I'm also passionate about ESG and social impact, and happiest working in mission-driven organizations.</p>
								<p> I'm proud to have served as a Peace Corps volunteer to Ukraine in an economic development program. I'm currently in Colorado splitting time between Denver and the high country of Summit County. Depending on time of year, I can be found out ski touring, climbing, mountain biking, paddleboarding or hiking with our two trouble-making border collies.</p>

								<p><b>Western Border Collie Rescue:</b> We volunteer and support Western Border Collie Rescue; Western Border Collie Rescue is an all-volunteer organization working in and around the Rocky Mountain region.

								<p><b>CAIC:</b> My partner and I are avid backcountry ski enthusiasts. Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) is an organization responsible for monitoring and reporting on snow and avalance conditions. With Colorado having a very volatile snowpack, their work is essential in enjoying the sport responsibly. More information on their website <a href="https://www.avalanche.state.co.us/">here.</a>

								<p>I really enjoy learning and reading. For fiction, I love post-apocalyptic and futurology books with a heavy lean towards cyberpunk. William Gibson is one of my favorite authors, with my first read of Neuromancer a life changing experience. </p>
								<p> The other area is around personal or professional development (often career and leadership related). Recent reads I've enjoyed have included Build by Tony Fadell, Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert, and Statistics Done Wrong by Alex Reinhart .</p>
